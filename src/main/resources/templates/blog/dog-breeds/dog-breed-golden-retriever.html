                            <p>The Golden Retriever originated in Scotland in the 19th century, bred by Lord Dudley Marjoribanks (later Lord Tweedmouth). He aimed to develop a hunting dog that could work in the wet climate of the Scottish Highlands, capable of tracking prey on land and retrieving from water.</p>
                            <p>The Golden Retriever was developed by crossing yellow Labrador Retrievers with the now-extinct Tweed Water Spaniel, later introducing Irish Setter, Bloodhound, and more Labrador Retriever bloodlines.</p>
                            <p>In 1908, the Golden Retriever was first registered with the Kennel Club in the UK. In 1925, the American Kennel Club officially recognized the breed. Today, the Golden Retriever has become one of the most popular family dogs worldwide.</p>
