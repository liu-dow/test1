                            <p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales, where they were used as herding dogs. Their low-set build was perfect for nipping at the heels of cattle while avoiding kicks. The breed's history dates back to at least the 10th century.</p>
                            <p>Corgis gained worldwide recognition when they became favorites of the British Royal Family, particularly Queen Elizabeth II, who owned more than 30 Pembroke Welsh Corgis throughout her lifetime. This royal connection helped popularize the breed globally.</p>
                            <p>Despite their small size, Corgis maintain their herding instincts and working dog mentality, combining intelligence with a strong desire to please their owners.</p>
