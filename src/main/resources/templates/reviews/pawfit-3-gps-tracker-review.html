        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="introduction mb-5">
            <p>One of the biggest fears for pet owners is losing their beloved companion during a walk or when they get
                spooked and run off. While calling their name might work sometimes, a GPS (Global Positioning System)
                tracker offers a reliable way to pinpoint your pet's location before they get into trouble.</p>

            <p>UK company Pawfit offers a GPS tracker specifically designed with your four-legged friend in mind.
                Lightweight, waterproof, and packed with cutting-edge features, we've thoroughly tested the Pawfit 3 to
                see if it lives up to the hype.</p>

            <p>In this comprehensive review, you'll discover everything you need to know about the Pawfit 3 GPS Tracker.
                We'll share our assessment of its performance, design, app functionality, activity monitoring
                capabilities, geofence features, and subscription plans to help you decide if the Pawfit 3 is the right
                choice for you and your pet.</p>

        <!-- Section 1: The Basics -->
        <section id="basics" class="mb-5">
            <h2><i class="bi bi-info-circle"></i> Key Features & Design</h2>

            <p>The Pawfit 3 Pet Tracker is developed by Latsen Technology, with the Pawfit 3 being their latest and most
                advanced model. It includes a fully embedded SIM card, impressive battery life, 4G technology, and a
                live tracking mode.</p>

            <div class="row align-items-center">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>Collar Attachment</h3>
                    <p>The dog-friendly design of the Pawfit 3 is immediately apparent. Weighing only 27g, it's
                        incredibly lightweight – once attached to your pet's collar, they'll barely notice it's
                        there.</p>

                    <p>Unlike many competitors that use simple rubber fastenings, Pawfit takes the design further with
                        smart technology built into the attachment itself. The device comes with a separate tracker
                        attachment base designed to fit securely on various collar and harness widths.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="/img/review/pawfit-3/pawfit-3-attachment.png" alt="Pawfit 3 collar attachment mechanism"
                         class="img-fluid rounded">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>To remove the tracker, you simply push the orange buttons and lift it off. This secure locking mechanism
                prevents it from accidentally falling off your pet's collar or harness during active play or
                exploration.</p>

            <p>Here's the clever part: once you've downloaded the companion app, you'll receive a notification if the
                device is ever removed from your pet's collar. This unique safety feature significantly sets the Pawfit
                3 apart from its competitors.</p>

            <div class="row align-items-center">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="/img/review/pawfit-3/pawfit-3-location-tracking.jpg"
                         alt="Pawfit mobile app interface showing location tracking" class="img-fluid rounded">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>Mobile App & Battery Life</h3>
                    <p>Setting up the Pawfit 3 is straightforward. Simply charge the device using the included charger
                        and download the app on your smartphone. Once fully charged, follow the instructions to pair the
                        device with the app, and you're ready to go!</p>

                    <p>The battery can last up to 8 days (depending on usage), which is one of the best battery lives
                        we've seen in pet GPS trackers. The device alerts you when the battery level drops below 15% –
                        the tracker itself flashes, and you receive a low battery notification on your phone.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Throughout our testing, we found the companion app intuitive and user-friendly. Despite being
                feature-rich, it's easy to navigate and use.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section: Location Tracking -->
        <section id="tracking" class="mb-5">
            <h2><i class="bi bi-geo-alt"></i> Location Tracking Performance</h2>

            <p>The GPS tracking works in real-time with two update frequency options: Passive and Live mode.</p>

            <div class="card mb-4">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <h3 class="h5">Passive Mode</h3>
                    <p>Depending on your pet's activity level, the Pawfit 3 automatically adjusts how frequently it
                        updates their location. In Passive mode, location updates occur between 30 seconds and 2 hours –
                        the more active your pet is, the more regularly the device updates the app.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">If your pet is running around playing, the tracker will update every 1-2 minutes.
                        With a premium subscription, you can increase this frequency to every 20 or 40 seconds.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="card mb-4">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <h3 class="h5">Live Tracking Mode</h3>
                    <p>When activated, Live Tracking increases location updates to every 5 seconds, providing the most
                        accurate and up-to-date information about your pet's whereabouts.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">To activate Live Tracking, select 'Find' at the bottom of the Map screen. This mode
                        only lasts 10 minutes to preserve battery life, but you can re-enable it as needed.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>We found that Passive mode accuracy was sufficient for regular walks, showing our pet's position while
                conserving battery life. Pawfit also offers options to add photos, videos, and mark key places on your
                route – features we found particularly useful for holidays and day trips when you might want a more
                detailed record of your walk.</p>

            <p>In addition to 'Find', Pawfit has added two more features to help locate your pet: Light and Alarm
                tracking. Once the Alarm or Light tracking is enabled, the tracker sounds and/or flashes for 10 minutes.
                We found these additional alerts particularly useful for locating pets in the dark or when they're
                hiding in dense vegetation.</p>

            <p>The final option, 'Voice', lets you record your voice or a command and play it through the device on your
                pet's collar. In our testing, this feature didn't work as well as we'd hoped – the sound from the device
                was somewhat muffled, and our dog seemed confused by it. However, having multiple location features at
                your disposal definitely makes for more confident walks.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: Additional Features -->
        <section id="features" class="mb-5">
            <h2><i class="bi bi-shield-check"></i> Smart Features & Safety Alerts</h2>

            <p>Beyond the basics, the Pawfit 3 Tracker is packed with advanced features specifically designed for pets,
                from safe zone to activity monitoring and various alerts.</p>

            <div class="row align-items-center">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>Safe Zone (Geofencing)</h3>
                    <p>For those unfamiliar with safe zones, they are virtual safety boundaries that alert you when your
                        pet enters or leaves a designated area. Like a real fence, they create a separation between that
                        location and the surrounding area.</p>

                    <p>We tested this feature by creating a geofence around our home. When our dog left this area during
                        a walk, we immediately received a notification. This feature provides peace of mind, especially
                        if you're concerned about your pet escaping from your yard or a pet sitter's home.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="/img/review/pawfit-3/safe-zone.webp" alt="Pawfit app showing geofence setup"
                         class="img-fluid rounded">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The Pawfit 3 allows you to set up multiple safe zones, which is particularly useful if you regularly
                visit different locations with your pet, such as a relative's house or a favorite park. You can easily
                add, edit, or delete these virtual boundaries through the app.</p>

            <h3>Activity Monitoring</h3>

            <p>The Pawfit 3 doesn't just track your pet's location – it also monitors their activity levels, similar to
                a fitness tracker for humans. The device tracks your pet's daily steps, calories burned, active hours,
                and rest hours. You can set daily activity goals based on your pet's breed, age, and weight, and the app
                will provide insights into their overall well-being.</p>

            <p>We found the activity monitoring to be a great addition, helping us ensure our dog was getting enough
                exercise and rest. The app presents this data in easy-to-understand graphs, making it simple to track
                trends over time.</p>

            <h3>Safety Alerts</h3>
            <p>Pawfit 3 offers several safety alerts to keep you informed:</p>
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">
                <li class="list-group-item"><i class="bi bi-bell-fill text-primary me-2"></i><strong>Removal
                    Alert:</strong> Notifies you if the tracker is removed from the collar attachment.

                <li class="list-group-item"><i class="bi bi-thermometer-half text-danger me-2"></i><strong>Temperature
                    Alert:</strong> Warns you if the ambient temperature around the tracker becomes too high or too low
                    (requires premium subscription).
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><i class="bi bi-battery-charging text-success me-2"></i><strong>Low Battery
                    Alert:</strong> Informs you when the battery is running low.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section id="subscription" class="mb-5">
            <h2><i class="bi bi-credit-card"></i> Subscription Plans & Pricing</h2>

            <p>Like most GPS pet trackers, the Pawfit 3 requires a subscription plan to cover the cost of the embedded
