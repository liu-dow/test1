                                        some point in their lives.

                                <h3 class="h4">Ultra-Lightweight Design</h3>
                                <p>Weighing just 20 grams, the Pawfit Lite is approximately 30% lighter than the
                                    standard Pawfit 3 model, making it ideal for cats and small dog breeds. Its compact
                                    size ensures it won't burden even the smallest pets during their daily

                                <p>The Pawfit Lite is particularly well-suited for:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Cat owners</strong> - Cats are notoriously sensitive to weight and bulk
                                        on their collars, making the ultra-light design perfect for feline friends
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Small dog breeds</strong> - Chihuahuas, Yorkshire Terriers, and other
                                        small breeds will barely notice the Pawfit Lite
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Owners of skittish pets</strong> - If your pet has rejected bulkier
                                        trackers in the past, the Lite's minimal profile might be the solution
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Urban pet owners</strong> - The device's strong cellular connectivity
