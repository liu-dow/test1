            <h2 class="h3 mb-4">1. Why You Need a Pet Tracker</h2>

            <p>According to the American Humane Association, approximately 10 million pets are lost in the United States
                each year, with only 15% of dogs and 2% of cats without identification ever being reunited with their
                owners <a href="https://www.americanhumane.org/fact-sheet/pet-identification/" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
                These statistics highlight the critical importance of having reliable methods to locate your pet if they
                go missing.</p>

            <div class="real-story p-4 bg-light rounded mb-4">
                <h3 class="h5 mb-3"><i class="bi bi-quote"></i> A Real-Life Story</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic">"Last summer, our Border Collie, Max, bolted after being startled by fireworks
                    during a camping trip. We spent hours searching the unfamiliar woods, calling his name until our
                    voices were hoarse. It wasn't until the next morning that a family found him nearly 5 miles away.
                    After that terrifying experience, we immediately invested in a GPS tracker. Three months later, when
                    Max slipped out through an open gate, we located him within minutes using the Tractive app. That
                    peace of mind is priceless." - Sarah, Tractive user</p>
            </div>

            <p>Beyond the emotional distress of losing a pet, there are practical reasons why a GPS tracker is becoming
                an essential tool for pet owners:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Escape artists:</strong> Some breeds and individual dogs are natural escape artists who can
                    jump fences, dig under barriers, or slip through small openings.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Outdoor adventures:</strong> If you enjoy hiking, camping, or other outdoor activities with
                    your dog, a GPS tracker provides an extra layer of security in unfamiliar environments.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Aging pets:</strong> Senior dogs may become disoriented or wander off due to cognitive
                    decline, making them particularly vulnerable to getting lost.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pet sitters and kennels:</strong> When others are caring for your pet, a GPS tracker allows
                    you to verify their location and ensure they're where they should be.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Peace of mind:</strong> Perhaps most importantly, a GPS tracker provides invaluable peace of
                    mind, allowing you to quickly locate your pet if they ever go missing.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>A study published in the Journal of Veterinary Behavior found that dogs who go missing are more likely to
                be recovered quickly when owners use GPS tracking technology compared to traditional search methods
                alone <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-veterinary-behavior"
                         target="_blank">[2]</a>. This research underscores the practical value of investing in a
                quality GPS tracker like the Tractive.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Accurate location tracking, unlimited range (with cellular
                                coverage), real-time updates</p>
                            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Require subscription plans, battery needs regular charging,
